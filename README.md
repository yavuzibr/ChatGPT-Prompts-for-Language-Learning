# ChatGPT-Prompts-for-Language-Learning
The purpose of this repo is about the language you want to learn in 5 main prompts: to form your general knowledge, to learn the resources you need to use, to create a program suitable for your level and to create sample exercises.
These prompts are created in order that even people who have no knowledge about the subject can use them. For better quality exercises, you can feed ChatGPT with sample data and use such prompts.
